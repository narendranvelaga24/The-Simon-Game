# The Simon Game

A web-based implementation of the classic Simon memory game. Test your memory by repeating increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds!

## Features

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Watch the sequence of button flashes and sounds.
